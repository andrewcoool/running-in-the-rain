For IB May 2020 Examination Period: IB Math SL Internal Assessment extras.

This is a short simulation written in Python for my IB Math IA.
This program uses collission and randomly generated raindrops to simulate "running in the rain" at different velocities and body tilts.

Run main.py to see results and an exported dataset.
